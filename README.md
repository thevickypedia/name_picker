# Name Picker
A perfect name picker script using python without any repetition/error even when all the names have been picked up at least once (as I was fed up finding one on google)

The script removes 70% of the names from list of names selected earlier so that the name which was picked last of the list doesn't get picked as first once when list exhausts
